# Amazon Music for Linux
This is an Amazon Music client for Linux powered by the web version of Amazon Music.
It is spoofing the agent as a windows machine which disables using flash. I made it because the website uses flash on linux and this is a way to spoof the agent permanently.

## Installing
[Download](https://github.com/danieldaeschle/amazon-music-linux/releases) the newest version for your distribution and install it.
